 * Every clinic runs the same template against a different repo and a different
 * DecapBridge site, so hardcoding a config.yml would mean hand-editing it for
 * each one. Both values are available at build time instead:
 *
 *   REPOSITORY_URL   set automatically by Netlify, e.g.
 *                    https://github.com/jeff-cmyk/tww-appleton
 *   DECAP_SITE_ID    set once per site in Netlify's environment variables,
 *                    from the site you create at decapbridge.com
 *
 * So a new clinic needs no code changes at all — just the env var.
